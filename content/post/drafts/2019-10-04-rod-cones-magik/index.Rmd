This blog post is in a series "Rods Cones Colour Magik" about understanding, using, and assess colours in R. 

Previously in [Part 1](), I discussed what colourblindness is, and how it impacts design. In this part, part 2, we discuss how to assess colour in R.

This post covers three areas:

1. How to assess current colours?
2. How to assess existing colours?
3. How to create better colours?

# How to assess current colours?

Whenever I see a data visualisation, I'm always cued in to look at the colours that people use in their plots. In particular, I keep an eye out for things that are not colourblind safe, and not perceptually uniform.

In particular, I'm wary of three scales:

1. Jet
2. Rainbow
3. Terrain.colours

```{r show-jet-rainbow-terrain, fig.height = 3, fig.asp = NULL, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(3, 1), mar=rep(1, 4))
p_img(rev(pals::jet(25)), "jet")
p_img(rainbow(25), "rainbow")
p_img(terrain.colors(25), "terrain.colours")
```

Why? 

Two main reasons:

1. Colourblindness: Those with colourblindness might not be able to distinguish the colours used. See [my post on colourblindness for more on this]()
2. Perceptual uniformity: For these colourscales, a one unit change in data value does not often mean a one unit change in perceived colour.

## Assessubg Colourblindness

If we know ahead of time the colours we want to use, we can look at the colours plotted against each other out of the context of a dataset

Let's demonstrate this by showing what the rainbow scale looks like for the different types of colourblindness:
Here's Rainbow:

```{r rainbow-pals-safe}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(rainbow(25))
pals::pal.safe(rainbow(25))
```

Jet:

```{r}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(pals::jet(25))
pals::pal.safe(pals::jet(25))
```

And Terrain Colours

```{r}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(terrain.colors(25))
pals::pal.safe(terrain.colors(25))
```

What does this mean?

Well, there are three categories of colourblindness:

- Deuteranopia:
- Protanopia:
- Tritanopia:

```{r}
terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  prismatic::check_color_blindness()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 25, palette = "oleron") %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 10, palette = "hawaii") %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 10, palette = "hawaii")[c(1,5,7)] %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()
```

## Perceptually uniform

I also discussed this term of "perceptually uniform" - this is defined as:

> a unit step of colour produces a constant perceptual change in color

One that I found useful was at this SO thread: 

> if a color space is perceptually uniform, it means that a change of length x in any direction of the color space would be perceived by a human as the same change -- [slhck](https://stackoverflow.com/users/435093/slhck)




# So how do you test out your colours?

Let's look at a few common scenarios.

1. Evaluating an existing palette
2. Creating a new palette
3. Evaluating a plot

## Evaluating an existing palette



## Creating a new palette

Say, for example that you were tasked with creating a Red Amber Green (RAG) palette for work, because, that's what they need.

Let's assume that Red, Amber, and Green are from bad to worse

```{r}
rag <- prismatic::colour(c("red", "orange", "green"))
colorspace::specplot(rag)
colorspace::demoplot(rag)

rag %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()
```


## Evaluating a plot


```{r}
colorspace::simulate_cvd()
colorspace::specplot(colorspace::terrain_hcl(n = 25))

colorspace::demoplot(colorspace::terrain_hcl(n = 25))
colorspace::demoplot(terrain.colors(n = 25))

colorspace::cvd_emulator(here::here("content/post/drafts/2019-10-04-using-and-testing-different-colour-palettes/imgs/fire-sprinkler.JPG"))
```




In the past I've told people to use 

This refers to the properties of a sequence of colours

Let's briefly explore these using two packages, [`prismatic`](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/prismatic), by [Emil Hvilfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt), and `colorspace` by ...


```{r}
library(prismatic) 
library(pals)

jet <- pals::jet(25)
jet_2 <- colorRampPalette(c("#00007F", "blue", "#007FFF", "cyan",
                     "#7FFF7F", "yellow", "#FF7F00", "red", "#7F0000"))
tc <- colour(terrain.colors(25))
tc_heat <- color(heat.colors(n = 25))
tc_rainbow <- color(rainbow(n = 25))

plot(tc)
```


```{r}
library(scico)
library(viridisLite)

tc_oleron <- color(scico(n = 20, palette = "oleron")) 
tc_bamako <- color(scico(n = 20, palette = "bamako")) 
tc_vir <- color(viridis(n = 20)) 
```



```{r}
pal.safe(tc)
```

# How do I test my colours?

So suppose you have a set of colours you want to use, how do you test them?

Put the colours into hex format, and then 

## Test the palette

The process is similar with a palette

## Testing the ggplot graphic

For a ggplot graphic, if you have a plot handy, you can use `colorblindr` to help
assess the colourblindness

# How do I test someone else's colours?

If you've got someone else's image, I know that there are ways you can simulate what colourblindness looks like, as I've seen people do this. But I'm actually not aware of how to do it myself.

# OK, so, what should I use then?

I'd recommend choosing from one of the following:

1. Viridis (only works for continuous colours (0-100))
2. Scico (which includes a terrain map)
3. ColorBrewer website

# Further reading

I initially started writing this blog post after seeing a lot of graphics that 
were good, but didn't use good colours scales. Once I started writing all this 
down, I did some more reading to bolster my understanding of colourscales. I
highly recommend reading the following to help you as well:

- [The refining plots chapter](https://socviz.co/refineplots.html#refineplots) of
the draft of [Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org/) Book, "Data Visualisation: A practical introduction"
- The [colour basics](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-basics.html) and 
[colour pitfalls](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html) chapters

- [This interesting chapter of percetually uniform colour spaces](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/) from the book, "Programming design systems", by [Rune Madsen](https://twitter.com/runemadsen)
- [This SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20172607/what-is-perceptually-uniform-color-space-and-how-lab-color-space-is-perceptually) also provided some interesting definitions:


- The [wikipedia article on colour difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference) is also quite interesting.

Note: I started this on '2019-10-04'

But what about those with colourblindness? How do we see what they might see? We can put the colours into `pals::pal.safe` or `prismatic::check_color_blindness`:



# What makes up colour?

I think describing colour is actually quite hard. I often hear people talk about "saturation, luminance, brightness, hue", and I actually get pretty confused.

But here's a graphic reproduced from the [excellent paper on colorspace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06490.pdf) by  ...


* Hue means different colour
* Chroma means **how much** of that colour is used (how _saturated_ it is)
* Luminance means how **bright** that colour is.

* great post on [imageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_basics/)

```{r pal-safe-red-green}
library(magrittr)
colorspace::demoplot(red_green)

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot(type = "pie")
```
