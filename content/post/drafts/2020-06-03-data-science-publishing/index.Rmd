*Last month Julia Lowndes and I presented a virtual fireside chat at the [Open Publishing Fest](https://openpublishingfest.org/) called "Data Science as an Entryway to Open Publishing". The abstract of our fireside chat was: The open source R programming language is a powerhouse for data analysis and statistics -- and it also is fueling open publishing through RMarkdown and a large, engaged, and innovative community. We will show community-created examples of tutorials, blogs, websites, manuscripts, books, etc, and discuss how this is an entryway to open science, preprints, and open scientific publishing. We welcome other contributed examples to showcase how R can streamline open publishing, as well as examples showcasing other programming languages. This post is some reflections from the experience and summary of our [slides](https://zenodo.org/record/3873698#.XtbQo8Z7nOQ).*

One of the (many) things that gets us excited about R is that the same workflow you use for data analysis -- that is rooted in reproducibility -- empowers you make your work available to the world...in ways you never imagined.

As Julia said in our presentation:

> I came to R for the data analysis, and was blown away by the publishing 

We then introduced RMarkdown, framed for scientific publishing and so much more.

# Using RMarkdown for scientific publishing: Fueling reproducibility in data science

## RMarkdown

RMarkdown powerfully combines executable R code with simple text formatting for efficient, automatable, reproducible research. It combines simple text formatting with R code, which means analyses and figures are in the same place as your reporting document. This saves time as you iterate, and enables good practices for reproducibility & versioning.

## RMarkdown's familiar outputs for science: Word documents and PDFs

RMarkdown renders to Word and PDF — imagine never copy-pasting a graph into your report again!!!! RMarkdown can also manage citations, cross-referencing figures and section headers.

But wait, you can also use RMarkdown behind your wildest dreams.

# Using RMarkdown beyond your wildest dreams: Reimagining sharing and publishing online

## RMarkdown: RMarkdown creates HTML files that can be shared openly on the web

We can render RMarkdown to HTML. And we can store and distribute HTML files on GitHub, which also offers display options for publishing. Suddenly you can share a URL rather than attaching a file — and that same URL will update rather than re-attaching a new version of the file!

We shared some real-world examples from science, including examples from the [Ocean Health Index](https://ohi-science.org/), [Alison Hill's academic](https://alison.rbind.io/post 2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown), [Ben Marwick's PhD thesis template formatting for the University of Washington ](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown), [Allison Horst's missing explorer lesson](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/missingexplorer)

These examples started with **single-page HTMLs**, with the ability to display floating table of contents and toggle between showing hiding code. And also **simple websites** that combine RMarkdown files as a website with a navigation bar between pages, and requires only GitHub to display. 

We also discussed **blogdown** that creates powerful websites with more complexity and blogging capabilities. This has been so important for creating blogs and tutorials to share code, discuss, and learn together. Why this important is nicely represented in this quote from the 2020 RStudio conference: 

> "If you want to learn to write, you read a lot, if you want to play music, you listen a lot. It's hard to do this with data analysis." - Hilary Parker & Roger Peng, RStudio::conf(2020) keynote

In addition to websites, RMarkdown can create **bookdown books** that organize and navigate html files as e-books. This is really powerful for organizing reports and documents.

We can also create **simple slides** from a single RMarkdown file. Imagine making a presentation and then being able to re-create presentations with updated data. Further, we can create **xaringan slides** that enable you to incorporate powerful styling options from within R (without requiring knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, etc). 

**learnr** provides the power of interactive tutorials from a friendly website interface. This is really exciting to think about reimagining teaching and how to blend lectures and hands-on coding for learners of all levels. 

# Discussion time

After going through the slides, we discussed with attendees...TODO complete


How does RMarkdown relate to/streamline the academic publishing process? Analog: rOpenSci software review process Friendly entryways to open science & publishing : you're already doing it w/ code Process affects the outcome: Easier to share at the end because you're already sharing with yourself throughout Not just R! Examples from other languages (Jupyter [note]books) Open publishing in the wild Education: allisonhorst.github.io, datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com, tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics, ida.numbat.space Programs: openscapes.org Accompanying science pubs: ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime
